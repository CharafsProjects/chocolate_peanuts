# Chocolate Peanuts

This repository contains my collected data of 713 colored chocolate peanuts from four different brands (m&m, ja!, Chateau, Mister Choc). Each brand is represented by ~400g colored chocolate peanuts. 

I've collected information like 
- color
- weight in gramm
- length in millimetre
- width in millimetre
- brand

This data can be used for analysis exercieses or to train supervised machine learning algorithm, like e.g. a decision tree. 

Have Fun!
